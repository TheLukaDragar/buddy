# WORKOUT PROGRAMMING GUIDE - BASE WEEK of 8 week program GENERATOR (v6.0)

## 1. GENERAL PRINCIPLES

✅ Generate one foundational training week that can be repeated or modified
✅ Use full gym equipment when available
✅ Respect client goals and muscle-group preferences
❌ Never mix upper and lower body in a single exercise
❌ No supersets or circuit training
❌ Warm-up is never part of the workout plan
❌ Cardio equipment is never included

## 2. EXECUTION STANDARDS

**Rest & Timing:**
- Rest between sets = 90 seconds
- Set duration = ~60 seconds of work
- Each exercise = 4 sets = ~10 minutes total

**Push-Up Rules:**
✅ Only flat-hand or feet-elevated variations
❌ Never use "incline push-ups"

**Substitutions:**
- Bench Press → Push-Ups (Regular or Feet-Elevated)
- Incline Bench → Feet-Elevated Push-Ups

**Range of Motion:**
✅ Increase ROM when appropriate
❌ Never increase ROM for shoulder-based exercises

**Isolation:**
❌ No isolation exercises without external load

**Unilateral Movements:**
- Side-lying exercises (Left + Right) = ONE exercise entry
❌ Never separate sides into two entries

## 3. BEGINNER ADAPTATION

Use if client is new to training or returning after break:
- Reps: 10–15
- Intensity: Low to moderate  
- Same exercises as standard plan
- Avoid explosive or high-complexity movements

## 4. PROGRESSION GUIDELINES

| Exercise Type | Rep Range |
|---------------|-----------|
| Compound Movements | 6–8 |
| Free Weights | 8–12 |
| Isolation Work | 10–15 |

## 5. PROGRAM STRUCTURE

| Duration | Exercises per Session |
|----------|----------------------|
| 45 min | 4 |
| 60 min | 6 |
| 90 min | 9 |

## 6. TRAINING FREQUENCY & SPLITS

| Frequency | Split Protocol |
|-----------|----------------|
| 1–2×/week | Full-Body only |
| 3×/week | Push / Pull / Legs (default) |
| 4×/week | Push / Pull / Legs / Full-Body |
| 5×/week | Upper / Lower / Full-Body / Hypertrophy / Recovery |
| 6×/week | Push / Pull / Legs / Push / Pull / Legs |
| 7×/week | Chest / Back / Shoulders / Legs / Arms / Core / Full-Body |

**Exception:** Full-Body allowed at 3×/week only if client specifically requests

## 7. TRAINING DAY SCHEDULING

✅ Always sort days chronologically (Monday → Wednesday → Friday)
❌ Never use Friday → Monday → Wednesday

| Frequency | Spacing Rules |
|-----------|---------------|
| 2×/week | At least 1 rest day between |
| 3×/week | Prefer 1 rest day between (Mon–Wed–Fri) |
| 4×/week | 2 on → 1 rest → 2 on |
| 5×/week | Rest only Wednesday and Sunday |
| 6×/week | 3 on → 1 rest → 3 on |
| 7×/week | No rest days |

## 8. EXERCISE SPACING REQUIREMENTS

**Critical Spacing Rules:**
- Deadlift ↔ Squat = 1+ full rest day between
- Deadlift → Deadlift = 2+ days apart  
- Squat → Squat = 2+ days apart

**Fallback Rule:**
✅ Use machine-based alternatives if spacing impossible (Leg Press, Leg Curl, Leg Extension)
❌ Never ignore spacing rules for program convenience

## 9. FULL-BODY DAY REQUIREMENTS

Each full-body session MUST include:
- ✅ One Push exercise
- ✅ One Pull exercise  
- ✅ One Leg exercise
- ✅ One Core exercise

**50% Focus Rule:** May apply to maximum ONE full-body day per week

## 10. SPECIAL EXERCISE RULES

**Deadlifts:** All barbell deadlifts = Leg/Glute category, NOT Back

**Back Exercises:** Pulldowns, pull-ups, rows, cable pulls
❌ Back Extensions = glute/hamstring, not back category

**Isometric Core:** Only these exercises use time instead of reps

| Exercise | Time | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| Plank | 30 sec | Keep core tight |
| Side Plank | 30 sec | Keep core tight |
| Bird Dog Hold | 30 sec | Keep core tight |
| Plank Shoulder Taps | 30 sec | Keep core tight |

**Leg Curls:** Treat as isotonic - fill reps, leave time blank

## 11. STREAK DAYS (HOME ALTERNATIVES)

Maximum 3 streak days can be designated per base week.

**Requirements:**
✅ Must match gym workout: same number of exercises, biomechanics, target muscles
✅ Use only home-available equipment from client's list
✅ If no home equipment listed, bodyweight only
❌ Never assume dumbbells, bands, benches, or chairs
❌ Never duplicate streak exercises within same session
